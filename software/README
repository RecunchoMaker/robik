# Some demo software for Robik

Here are some little python programs to play with Robik.

## Patrones

This is a simple demo: just run it and Robik will do random nice patterns with the cube.


## Solver

This is a simple for a Rubik's cube, using "CFOP" (cross, F2l, OLL and PLL). There are room for a lot of improvement here!. You need OpenCV for python and a webcam.
