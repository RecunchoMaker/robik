# Robik files

Here are all the files needed to build Robik, a *rubik-cube-manipulator printbot*, including Arduino firmware, the 3d model, and simple software demos.

More info about Robik, including build instructions,  at [recunchomaker.org/robik][ROB01]

This is an early -but functional- release. Feel free to explore. All suggestions are welcome!
